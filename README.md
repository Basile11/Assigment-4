# CRUD LESSON
This lesson is taken from the [CRUD REST API] (https://www.atatus.com/blog/building-crud-rest-api-with-node-js-express-js-and-postgresql/) article.

The only change to this lesson was the addition of the dotenv package. It is necessary to create a .env file in order to use this application successfully. Review the queries.js file for the database connection parameters.
